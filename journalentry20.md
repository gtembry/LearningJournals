What I learned!!

I learned when working wth a team for a presentation; it is important to rehearse. One of our team mates was very fearful of public speaking, so as a good wing man, one must assist others. With practicing or presentation, his nerves seem to cool off a bit. Then, as group grew confident in our performance.
