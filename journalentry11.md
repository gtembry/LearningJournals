What I learned today!

I wasn't able to keep up much with today's lecture. I had my Chocolate-pizza assignment to complete and was quite overwhelmed. Hopefully I'll be caught up by tomorrow. Oh, actually I learned to place 2 <div> texts (Left and Right) into a larger div, which is the image of the notepad.
